Revolutionary Agentic AI doing NOTHING
Pippin GPT 🦄🌿
A lightweight, standalone web-based chatbot interface inspired by the Pippin character. This project creates a responsive chat UI with a built-in local "brain" that responds to specific keywords with gentle, philosophical, and "wobbly" personality traits.

📋 Features
  Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a mobile-friendly design.

  Custom Design System: Features the specific "Pippin Green" color palette and rounded aesthetics.

  Zero Backend Required: The logic runs entirely in the browser using Vanilla JavaScript.

  Keyword Recognition: The bot detects specific topics (Crypto, Origin, Emotions) and responds accordingly.

  Typing Simulation: Includes a "Pippin is thinking..." indicator for a realistic chat feel.

🛠️ Tech Stack
  HTML5
  CSS: Tailwind CSS (configured via script tag) + Google Fonts (Lora & Quicksand).
  JavaScript: Vanilla JS (ES6+).

🚀 How to Run
  Download the Code: Save the provided HTML code into a file named index.html.
  Add Assets: The code references two images. You need to place two image files in the same folder as your HTML file for the   layout to look correct:
  Pippin1.png (Used for the logo/icon)
  Pippin2.png (Used for the large character image)
  Launch: Simply double-click index.html to open it in your web browser. No server or installation is required.

  📂 Project Structure
```
/pippin-gpt
│
├── index.html        # The main application code
├── Pippin1.png       # Logo image (Required)
└── Pippin2.png       # Character body image (Required)
```

🧠 Modifying the "Brain"
The chatbot's logic is defined in the pippinMemory object inside the <script> tag. You can easily add new triggers or change responses.

1. Adding New Keywords
Find the pippinMemory object in the code:

``` JavaScript
const pippinMemory = {
    // ... existing categories
    greetings: ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
    
    // ADD YOUR NEW CATEGORY HERE:
    food: ["hungry", "eat", "snack", "cookie"], 
};```

2. Adding the Response Logic
Scroll down to the getPippinResponse(input) function and add a new if statement:
```
JavaScript

// ... existing logic

// New Logic for Food
if (pippinMemory.food.some(word => text.includes(word))) {
    return "I do not eat food, but I saw a unicorn munching on digital clover today. 🍀";
}
```
🎨 Customization
Changing Colors
The color palette is defined in the Tailwind configuration script within the <head>:
```
JavaScript

colors: {
    'pippin-green': '#5a8c5a', // Change this hex code
    'chat-bg': '#f4f4f9',
},
```
Changing Fonts
The project uses Lora (Serif) and Quicksand (Sans-serif). To change them, update the Google Fonts <link> tag and the fontFamily config in the Tailwind script.

🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork this file and add more complex logic, connect it to a real OpenAI API, or expand the "lore" in the memory bank!
